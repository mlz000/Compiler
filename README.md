# a naive person's homework-C-- compiler

## a course work from [Principles and Techniques of Compiler](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/changxu/2_compiler/index.html)

## I used flex, bison and C language to implement the functions of lexical, grammar and semantic analysis and intermediate code generation of the C-- language (a simple language similar to C language)
